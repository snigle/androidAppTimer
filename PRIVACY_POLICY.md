# Privacy Policy for AppTimer

**Last Updated:** 2024-07-26

Thank you for using AppTimer ("the App"). This Privacy Policy is here to help you understand what information the App collects, how it's used, and what your choices are.

## 1. Information We Collect

Our primary goal is to provide you with a simple and effective app timer without collecting your personal data.

**a) App Usage Data:**
To function, the App requires access to your device's application usage statistics (`PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS`). This includes information about which applications you use and for how long. This information is used solely to provide the core functionality of the App, which is to monitor and report app usage time to you.

**All app usage data is stored locally on your device and is never uploaded, shared, or transmitted to us or any third party.**

**b) Personally Identifiable Information (PII):**
We do **not** collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, phone number, or location.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

The information collected is used exclusively to:

- Provide, operate, and maintain the features of the App.
- Display your app usage statistics directly to you within the App.
- Run the foreground service required for the timer to function.

## 3. Data Storage and Security

All data generated by the App, including your usage statistics and configuration, is stored in the App's private storage on your device. It is not accessible by other applications. We take reasonable measures to protect this data, but no method of electronic storage is 100% secure.

## 4. Permissions Required

- **`PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS`**: To access app usage history for the timer functionality.
- **`FOREGROUND_SERVICE`**: To allow the timer service to run reliably in the background.
- **`QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES`**: To list all installed applications so you can configure them.

## 5. Third-Party Services

The App does not use any third-party services that would cause your data to be shared. All functionality is self-contained within the application.

## 6. Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If you believe that your child has provided this kind of information, we strongly encourage you to contact us immediately, and we will do our best to promptly remove such information.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
